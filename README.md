## Introduction

As current undergraduate students, we wanted to reflect on our college application process and learn about different colleges in the United States. There are many factors that one might consider when applying to colleges. Many colleges advertise their high endowments, geographic location, and nearby neighborhoods or local communities to entice students into looking into and eventually applying to them. In addition, some students are attracted to the low acceptance rate of universities, as it makes the school seem more elite, competitive, and selective. Other factors that may be of consideration for a student are whether they want to attend a large state university or a smaller private school, as well as what percent of students who enrolled actually graduate from the university. To get a better understanding of the different colleges in the United States, we want to see if these factors are related to one another, and if so, how.

## Webapp Overview

To explore the different colleges in the United States, we used R package ggplot2 to create our visualizations.
